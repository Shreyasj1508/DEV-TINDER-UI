## Usage

### Video Call Feature

**How to use video call between two users on different devices:**

1. **Login on two devices:**
   - User 1 logs in on Device 1.
   - User 2 logs in on Device 2.

2. **Navigate to chat:**
   - Both users go to the chat URL with each other: `http://localhost:5173/chat/<otherUserId>`
   - Replace `<otherUserId>` with the user ID of the person you want to call.

3. **Start and join video call:**
   - User 1 clicks the "Start Video Call" button in the chat.
   - User 2 clicks the "Join Video Call" button or receives a prompt to join.

4. **Allow camera and microphone access:**
   - Both users must allow browser access to their camera and microphone.

5. **Enjoy live video chat:**
   - The system automatically connects both users in the same room. No manual room ID needed.

6. **End call:**
   - Either user can click the close button to leave the call.

**Note:** If deployed, replace `localhost:5173` with your domain.
