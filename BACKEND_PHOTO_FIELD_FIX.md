# Backend Photo Field Fix

## Issue Identified
- Backend uses `photo` field name for photo URLs
- Frontend was checking `photoURL` and `photoUrl` first
- Need to prioritize `photo` field from backend

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Image Utilities (`imageUtils.js`)
- Moved `photo` to first priority in field name checking
- Enhanced URL validation to be more lenient
- Added specific debugging for backend's `photo` field

### 2. Updated UserCard Component
- Now checks `user.photo` field first before fallback
- Added detailed console logging for backend photo field
- Better error handling and debugging

### 3. Enhanced Debug Tools
- PhotoDebugPanel now highlights backend's `photo` field
- Console logs show specific backend photo field data
- Feed component logs detailed photo information

## Testing Steps

1. **Open browser console** to see detailed photo logs
2. **Click the üîçüì∑ debug button** to see photo field analysis
3. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   === PHOTO DEBUG FOR BACKEND 'photo' FIELD ===
   User 1: John Doe { photoField: "actual_url_here", ... }
   ```

## Expected Behavior Now

- ‚úÖ Checks `user.photo` field first (your backend field)
- ‚úÖ Falls back to other fields if `photo` is empty
- ‚úÖ Shows detailed debugging information
- ‚úÖ More lenient URL validation
- ‚úÖ Better error messages

## Debug Output

You should now see in console:
```javascript
UserCard Photo Debug for Backend: {
  userId: "123",
  userName: "John Doe", 
  backendPhotoField: "https://example.com/photo.jpg", // This should have value
  detectedPhotoUrl: "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
  finalPhotoUrl: "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
  allPhotoFields: { photo: "url_here", ... }
}
```

If `backendPhotoField` is still null/undefined, then the backend isn't sending the `photo` field properly.

## Next Steps

1. Check the console logs to verify `photo` field has values
2. Use debug panel to see all photo fields for each user
3. If `photo` field is still empty, check backend API response

The system now prioritizes your backend's `photo` field and provides detailed debugging to identify any remaining issues.
